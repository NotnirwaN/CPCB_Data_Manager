# CPCB_Data_Manager
The following repository contains simple sets of code to clean, restructure, and assess data downloaded from the Central Pollution Control Board Data

# Conditions for Computation
There are two primary conditions for this code to work:

1. Six Variables' Necessity
The code still needs a consistent data structure to pick the right things from the right place. One may download data for multiple stations from official CPCB CAAQMS portal [https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/login ](https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing)https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing
Yet, the data must be downloaded for only 6 variables, i.e. pollutant concentration/meteorological parameters.
This is what the data must look like. You may refer to the Sample Data folder for Bangalore.

2. Required Library Versions
These are the versions this code was developed upon. It may work on other versions IDK.
  pandas  2.0.3
