# CPCB_Data_Manager
The following repository contains simple sets of code to clean, restructure, and assess data downloaded from the Central Pollution Control Board Data

# Conditions for Computation
There are two primary conditions for this code to work:

1. Six Variables' Necessity
The code still needs a consistent data structure to pick the right things from the right place. One may download data for multiple stations from official CPCB CAAQMS portal [https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/login ](https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing)https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing
Yet, the data must be downloaded for only 6 variables, i.e. pollutant concentration/meteorological parameters.
